*Abstract Data Type_Definition: a mathematical object togather with operations
	*Programming is about problem solving but not about C++ keywords
	*For ploblem solving we need math

*Data Structure_Definition:a particular implementation of an A.D.T.

A.D.T.				D.S.
Interger			int (long)
+ - * =				
MOD DIV				
real numbers			float
proposition			bool
Matrix				
Vector
Set
Sequences
Graph


*Formalize Problem (by using a Mathematical object)
	-GRAPH
	-Incempatible turns are connected
	-Partitioning a graph = coloring a graph


ABCDE roads (star shaped)
B only out
E only in

AE	AD	AC
BA	BC	BD	BE
CA	CD	CE

no	AC-BC,AC-BD,AD-BD,
	BE-AE,BE-AD,BE-AC,
	CA-BA,CA-BC,CA-BD,CA-BE

*Formulate an Algorithm	(establish the required operations) A.D.T
	algorithm draft1
		pick a vertex V
		pick a color C
		while there is uncolored vertices
			for every vertex u
				if u is not adjacent to V
					color u by C
*Refine Algorithm (getting draft closer to C++)
*Code
